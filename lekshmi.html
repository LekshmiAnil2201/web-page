        <h3>A Little about Myself</h3>

        <img src="luxx.jpg" width="200">

        <p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Luxx. Iâ€™m just a regular person who loves hanging out with friends, 
        laughing at silly jokes, and eating way too many snacks. I enjoy watching movies, 
        listening to music, and sometimes doing absolutely nothing (yes, thatâ€™s a hobby ðŸ˜…). 
        I donâ€™t take life too seriously â€” I believe every day should have a little fun, 
        a little chill, and maybeÂ aÂ napÂ orÂ two.</p>

        <h3>Connect with me</h3>

        <p>I love meeting new people and sharing ideas, so feel free to connect with me! 
        Whether itâ€™s to say hi, share a funny meme, or just check out what Iâ€™m up to, 
        you can always reach me on Instagram. Donâ€™t be shy â€” come join the fun side ofÂ myÂ world!Â ðŸ“¸âœ¨</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>I can finish a packet of chips in one go</li>
            <li>I believe pizza tastes better at midnight</li>
            <li>Naps are my superpower</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Want More, Take a look!!</h3>

        <p>Instead of keeping all this beauty to myself, I thought Iâ€™d share a few pictures for you to enjoy. Consider it a gift â€” because looking at me is basically free therapy. Youâ€™reÂ welcome!ðŸ“¸âœ¨
